<h1>Bootstrap CFML Application</h1>

<p>
	Getting started is sometimes the hardest thing you can do.  That first step always seems to be the biggest.  It needn't be that way.  Let us help.
</p>

<p>
	We've pulled together a very simple 'structure' that you can use to get started with an application that simply authenticates users.  There is a public
	section and a secure section.  You can't get to the secure section unless you are logged in.  Easy eh?
</p>

<p>
	We have all the CFML code laid out in a clean, documentated and easy to read manner so you can understand exactly what happens at each stage.   This uses
	the well known <a href="./?/app_application_cfc"><code>Application.cfc</code></a> concepts to achieve this.
</p>

<p>
	You can try it for yourself here by visiting the link below, or download the .ZIP file and get up and running yourself.   Feel free to use this as your
	basis for your own CFML applications.
